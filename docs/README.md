# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This folder centralizes the processes and artifacts teams use to plan, run, and improve projects. The materials here are designed to preserve institutional knowledge, accelerate onboarding, and provide a single place to find decision records, checklists, and role responsibilities.

OctoAcme’s process follows a lifecycle approach: disciplined initiation (stakeholder alignment, chartering, and acceptance criteria), structured planning (roadmaps, scope, and resourcing), and execution with continuous tracking (milestone-driven work, progress dashboards, and status reporting). Releases go through formal release and deployment procedures including pre-release checklists and environment verification. Each phase produces explicit artifacts and decision points so work is transparent and auditable.

Roles and personas are defined to reduce single-person risk and ensure clear ownership. Core roles include project managers (governance, schedule, and stakeholder liaison), product owners/business leads (prioritization and requirements), engineering leads and developers (technical delivery and estimates), and QA/test engineers (validation and acceptance). Role responsibilities include owning key artifacts and running ceremonies that align the team to outcomes.

Communication and quality assurance are embedded in the workflow. The process prescribes regular team check-ins, stakeholder updates, centralized channels for visibility, and escalation paths for risks and impediments. Quality is enforced through acceptance criteria at initiation, ongoing QA during execution, release checklists for deployments, and retrospective-driven continuous improvement to capture lessons learned.
